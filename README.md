## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

From this chart we can see that the peak for duration of bike trips is 5 hours. The average trip duration is likely between 5-7 hours. The curve is right skewed, meaning the mode is higher than the mean. After 5 hours, the amount of trips slopes down. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

There is a large difference in the trip duration curve for men compared to women. The trip duration curve is flatter for women. As trip durations increase, we see the difference in total riders by gender decrease. Both curves for men and women experience fewer riders as trip duration increases. 

### Trips by Weekday

We see increased trip activity during the weekday between 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm. On the weekends, there is a steady amount of activity during the day from 10am-6pm.

### Trips by Gender

From this heatmap we can tell that most users are male, they take more trips than females and unknown. The heatmap for male and female users follow the same trends we saw in the 'Trips by Weekday' visualization. 

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

Subscribers are more likely than customers to share their gender. We see higher trip activity for male and female subscribers on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Overall, we see that male subscribers have the highest trip count.

### Starting and Ending Locations

Both starting and ending locations are concentrated in the same areas, these could be tourist areas. This data helps us determine where to place bike-sharing locations to best meet the needs of users. 

### BikeID Trip Counts

This chart tells us which bikes (based on bike ID) have been used for the msost trips. This will help us plan ahead to determine which bikes will need repairs sooner.  


## Summary

The total number of rides for the month of August was 2,344,224. We have learned rider trends that can help investors optimize user experience such as average trip duration and peak bike-sharing hours.
